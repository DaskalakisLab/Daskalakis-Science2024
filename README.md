# SciencePaper
This folder contains code for all the analyses I ran for the 1st Science Paper 
(Systems Biology Dissection of PTSD and MDD across brain regions, cell-types and blood) 
submission. This folder is split into two main subfolders Code which contains all
the scripts used for analysis and Data which contians all the data objects and output
from the scripts. In almost all cases, the subfolders in Code will have a corresponding 
folder in Data where the output is saved.

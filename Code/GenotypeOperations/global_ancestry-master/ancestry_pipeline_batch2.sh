## Call subject ancestries (1000 subjects are processed at a time enhance built in parallelization)
#Note: This is programmed to run on a local node. Generally this is not a problem even for hundreds of thousands of subjects.
#If you MUST run this as a job script, then edit the call_ancestry_v2_may6_2016.sh file,
#replacing the final 'bash' command with your job submission command.
